 ### A Concise Definition:
A web application firewall is a security policy enforcement point positioned between a web application and the client endpoint. This functionality can be implemented in software or hardware, running in an appliance device, or in a typical server running a common operating system. It may be a stand-alone device or integrated into other network components. *(Source: [PCI DSS IS 6.6](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/information_supplement_6.6.pdf))*
